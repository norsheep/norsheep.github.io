My name is **Yuanyi Song**, and I am currently a senior student at the Artificial Intelligence of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of Prof. **Weinan Zhang**. I have received my direct PHD’s offer from the School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Shanghai Innovation Institute.

My research interests include (multimodal) large language models, and LLM-based agents.
